# Package Manager

If you are Linux/MacOS user, you are probably familiar with `apt`, `brew`. If so, you can skip this section.

For Windows users, checkout [`winget`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) and/or [`scoop`](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop), [`chocolatey`](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco).

Graphical installers sometimes offer installation options that, if missing, can cause problems. For example, if you install Python without adding it to your PATH environment variable, you will need to add it manually later. Package managers can often help you avoid this problem.

## UniGetUI

[UniGetUI](https://github.com/marticliment/UniGetUI) is a GUI for `winget` and other package managers. It is easier to use if you are still not familiar with command line.
