# Coding Prerequisites

This section covers the prerequisites for general coding. This section aims to help non-coding people to get started with coding and to use this codebase. Feel free to skip any topics if you are experienced. Notice that the README in each repository will be brief and with only project-specific information, with assumption that you are already familiar with the topics in this section.

Please contact the maintainer if you find any difficulties in understanding the content. This will be helpful to improve the readability and may help others in the future.
